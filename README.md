## What
Flare is a library designed to allow quick and precise particle effect creations. It does not concern itself with displaying and only with the management and movement of particles. As such, it can easily be integrated into any existing or future application.

## So What's Different? Why Should I Use This?
Usually in particle systems the way you control things is by describing various states on the emitter. Flare instead takes a much more fine-grained approach by allowing you to control individual particles and describe their movement and change over time.

## Hokai, Cool. Where Can I See This?
Flare is currently not finished in any manner. Please wait warmly while I work on it.
